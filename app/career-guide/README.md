## 🎓 CareerPath AI – Career Counselling by analysing academic behaviour

The Career Guide component is a core module of the RP-Client frontend that delivers personalized, AI-driven career recommendations to users.
It focuses on transforming user attributes into actionable career guidance rather than static suggestions.

This component serves as the primary interaction layer between the user and the career recommendation intelligence.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Component

Traditional career guidance systems often provide generic and rule-based suggestions that fail to consider individual differences.

The Career Guide component addresses this limitation by:

Analyzing personal attributes

Applying validated psychological models

Presenting transparent and understandable recommendations

Guiding users with next-step actions, not just results

## 🧠 How the Solution Addresses the Sub-Problem

This component focuses on personalized analysis of user attributes, such as:

Personality traits

Interests

Skills and preferences

# Key Contributions

## 👤 User Requirements Addressed

The Career Guide component was designed to satisfy the following user needs:

✅ Personalized career recommendations tailored to individual profiles

✅ Transparent outcomes, allowing users to understand why a career is suggested
